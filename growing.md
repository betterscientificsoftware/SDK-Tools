## SDK Community Building

Once a logical set of potential member packages has been identified, the work of bringing together software development teams coming from potentially very diverse cultures and work backgrounds begins. A good goal to begin with is to define an initial set of community policies for the SDK. A Progress Tracking Card (PTC) outlining an approach to [define and adopt SDK Community Policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ay8n8l8rg8TA92NpajktFA8Ua7p-fKF9RAzG92WQilk/edit?usp=sharing) is available from the [Better Scientific Software](https://bssw.io) Team. Additionally, to promote a stronger, more functional community it is important to consider several factors:

1. Community policies should be discussed among all development teams. When applicable, it is important to have representation from members with a variety of software engineering expertise and maturity. Mandatory policies should not be estabilshed that many potential members cannot feasibly comply with unless the policy is absolutely necessary. Such policies can be recommended, potentially with a plan for when to make them mandatory.

1. Bringing to gether many development teams will usually require an intentional effort to establish common vocabulary and vision. Early on, people may frequently talk past each other due to a lack of these common building blocks. Working towards these common goals can help promote team building. It is usually not possible to obtain consensus on all major issues, but achieving a common understanding is important for a high-functioning community.

1. It is not necessary for the entire development team of a member package to be engaged in the SDK effort, but the team members that are engaged need to have enough leverage to implement agreed to community policies that the project is not already compatible with.

1. Establishing workflows and policies and doing planning activities for the SDK community does not replace these activities at the member package level.
